* Comment Tags

These are groups or categories that I will scatter throughout comments. When I
want to find all comments of a certain category quickly, I can just search for
the tag. Each tag will be preceeded by '@' to make for easy searching. Here is a
list of comment tag categories.

  - @win32 :: Marks code that uses the Win32 API, and that needs to be 
              split out into a separate Windows platform layer.
  - @error :: Marks code paths where error handling should be implemented
  - @temp :: Temporary solution that needs more work
